  This extension provides PHP language bindings for the functions and constants
  exposed by the <link xlink:href="http://getdnsapi.net/">getdns API and library</link>.
  getdns is a modern, asynchronous DNS API that simplifies access to advanced DNS
  features, including DNSSEC. This extension is built on top of the getdns
  implementation developed as a joint project between
  <link xlink:href="http://labs.verisigninc.com/en_US/innovation/verisign-labs/index.xhtml">Verisign Labs</link>
  and <link xlink:href="http://nlnetlabs.nl/">NLnet Labs</link>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Additional information about the API and the functions that implement it can be found
  on the <link xlink:href="http://getdnsapi.net/spec.html">getdns web site</link>.

 <para>
  Dictionaries and lists: the getdns API and library organize information using data
  structures called "dictionaries" and "lists". Dictionaries are similar to associative
  arrays in PHP. Elements are identified by a character string and can be set and
  retrieved using the string as a reference. Lists are similar to indexed arrays.
  Elements are identified by an integer key and can be set and retrieved using the
  integer index as a reference. This extension uses an integer reference that
  represents the memory address for dictionaries and lists created by the getdns
  library. Values can be set or retrieved using functions provided by the getdns
  library. Dictionaries and lists can also be converted to PHP arrays (and vice-versa)
  using a set of non-API functions provided by this extension.
 </para>
 <para>
  Transaction identifiers: the getdns library uses 64-bit unsigned integers to
  represent the transaction identifiers associated with asynchronous operations.
  PHP 5.x doesn't provide native support for 64-bit unsigned integers, so this
  extension represents transaction identifier values as 16-character hexadecimal
  strings that represent the 64-bit identifier value.
